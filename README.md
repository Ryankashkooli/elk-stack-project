# elk-stack-project

This is a project I worked on in the cybersecurity bootcamp where several resources were used to deploy an ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Mietricbeat, Filebeat, and Kibana). This Stack's intended function is to be a monitoring server to aggregate logs from two web servers that have DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) installed on them. I utilized Docker and Ansible to install the DVWA and ELK Stack container images on the VMs. I will provide more details for this project within this repository.
